Make a stack with 4 instruments in the key desired.

The 1st and 2nd instrument should have 4 steps and have notes in each step from the scale chosen. These two instruments should have notes that come from chords for that key and so they harmonize.

The 3rd and 4th instruments will harmonize with instrument 1 and 2 on every 3rd step of their 12 steps. So first step 1 will harmonize with the first step in instrument 1 and then the 4th step will harmonize with step 2 of instrument 1 and 2. 

Remember when instruments have a number of steps they all fit into the same cycle so the instruments 3 and 4 are playing three times as fast as instrument 1 and 2. 

First create version that has these "anchor" notes matching for all 4 instruments and then fill in the rest of the notes in instrument 3 and 4 with rests for now.
